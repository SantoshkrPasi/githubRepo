Project Overview:
This project is a web application designed to provide users with an interactive interface to explore GitHub user profiles and repositories. The main functionalities include user search, repository pagination, and dynamic content rendering.

User Interface:
The HTML document includes elements such as "repositories," "prev," "next," "input," "repo-count," "url," "image," and "details," serving as placeholders for dynamically rendered content.

GitHub API Interaction:
The heart of the application lies in making asynchronous calls to the GitHub API using the fetch function. The searchUser and getUser functions handle these requests to retrieve user and repository information.

Pagination and Navigation:
Users can navigate through different pages of repositories using the "prev" and "next" buttons. Tab navigation functionality is also present, allowing users to switch between tabs representing different pages of repositories.

Dynamic Content Rendering:
The displayRepositories function dynamically creates HTML elements to present detailed information about repositories, including names, descriptions, and programming languages.

Interactive Features:
Tabs change color dynamically, indicating the active tab. The application also allows users to adjust the number of repositories displayed per page through an input control.

User Feedback and Error Handling:
Loading spinners provide visual feedback during data retrieval, and the application gracefully handles scenarios where a user is not found or when no repositories are associated with a user.

Profile and Repository Details:
User details, such as name, bio, location, and Twitter handle (if available), are displayed prominently. Similarly, repository details include names, descriptions, and associated programming languages.

Customization Options:
Users have the flexibility to customize the number of repositories displayed per page, offering a tailored experience based on their preferences.

Overall Design:
The application combines functionality with an appealing design, making it user-friendly and visually engaging. It offers an efficient way for users to explore GitHub profiles and repositories.
